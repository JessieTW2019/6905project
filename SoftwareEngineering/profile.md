# Create-Edit Profile Page
The profile page is designed for the users to fill out their personal information. In the case of students, the idea is to create a profile that will attract professor and increase their chances of being approved for a project. In the case of Project Managers, some of the information shown here will be displayed along side their projects, so we recommend for project managers to fill out the information in a way that will be appealing for students. Although students will not be able this information directly, some of this information will be displayed.
