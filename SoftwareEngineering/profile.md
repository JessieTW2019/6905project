# Profile Page
The profile page is designed for the users to fill out their personal information. In the case of students, the idea is to create a profile that will attract professor and increase their chances of being approved for a project. In the case of Project Managers, some of the information shown here will be displayed along side their projects, so we recommend for project managers to fill out the information in a way that will be appealing for students. Although students will not be able this information directly, some of this information will be displayed 

The fields to fill out, are as follows:

### Section 1: First Impressions

1. A link to the image you wish to use for your profile: Since we do not allow users to upload images, we do allow users to upload their pictures elsewhere, and simply add a link to their image. 
2. First Name: If you have more than one first name (ie a middle name), feel free to add them here, but this is optional. Only the first name should be added here.
3. Last Name: If you have more than one last name, feel free to add them here.
4. Summary or Profile (500 Char Max): The idea of this profile is the same as what you would see in a resume or CV. In a short paragraph, introduce yourself, let us know what you want or wish to accomplish, or what makes you different from the rest.
