# Notifications Page

For now, the notifications page is only functional for the Project Managers, as it only displays student's request to participate in a given project. Application request displays 3 options for the project manager to select( accept, deny, and more information). The accept option adds the student as a participant to the project, while the deny option rejects the student. The third option, simply displays more information about the student, allowing the project manager to make a better descision about which students to accept into his/her projects.
