# Apply to Project - Option

Since the home page displays all available projects to the student, the student is free to select whatever project(s) he/she may want to join. After clicking the apply button, a second window pops up asking the student to confirm his choice. If the student selects "close", he is simply taken back to the previous page, but no request is actually sent to the system. If the student selects apply, a notification of type "Student Request" is sent to the project manager.
